# Introduction
In this repository, I am documenting my daily learning and practice of data structures and algorithms. My aim is to gain a deep understanding of fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables, as well as algorithms like sorting, searching, graph traversal, and dynamic programming.

# Learning Goals
My main goals for this learning journey include:

* Mastering the fundamental data structures and their operations. <br>
* Understanding various algorithms and their time and space complexities. <br>
* Developing problem-solving skills through algorithmic challenges. <br>
* Applying data structures and algorithms to solve real-world problems efficiently. <br>

# Progress
I will update this section regularly to track my progress and highlight the topics I have covered. Here's a summary of my achievements so far:

25 June, 2023: Started learning about Patterns [Loops & Matrix].

This section will serve as a journal of my learning journey, enabling me to see my growth over time and providing a reference for others interested in following along.

# Contributing
As I continue my learning journey, I welcome contributions from the community. If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional resources related to data structures and algorithms, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Together, we can create a valuable resource for learners like us.
